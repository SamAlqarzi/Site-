# Project Objective:
The goal of this project was to pick a dataset, analyze it, apply it to solve a business problem.
# Picking the Dataset:
Me and my team obtained our dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lepchenkov/usedcarscatalog). This dataset was collected in 2019
in Belarus (Western Europe), and has about 30 variables (features) most of which are categorical. These variables are decriptive features of the used
cars ranging from car models to engine type.
# Target variable:
our target in this case was to test for any correlation each feature the car has to influence the selling price.
with most of those car features being categorical, we had to transform all of them into numerical to be able to perform linear regression models.
